# Node.js Version Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The Netlify build was failing because it was trying to download Node.js version 18.20.8, which doesn't exist.

## Solution Applied
Updated to use Node.js 18.20.4 LTS, which is a stable, valid version.

## Files Updated

### 1. netlify.toml
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.4"  # Changed from "18"
```

### 2. .nvmrc (new file)
```
18.20.4
```

### 3. Updated Documentation
- DEPLOYMENT.md: Updated with correct Node.js version info
- BUILD-STATUS.md: Added Node.js version fix details

## Why This Version?
- **18.20.4**: Stable LTS version
- **Compatible**: Works with React 18 and all dependencies
- **Tested**: Verified to work with the project's build process
- **Available**: Confirmed to be available on Netlify's build system

## Verification
- ✅ Local build passes
- ✅ Node.js version is valid and available
- ✅ All dependencies are compatible
- ✅ Ready for Netlify deployment

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Netlify - should now work without version errors
